                    <p>The First Responders Protect Plan (FRPP) was created after extensive research and
                        consultation with our current clients as well as other first responders like yourselves.</p>

                        <p>We found that there were some detrimental gaps in your current group insurance plans that are
                        in force thought the government or private employers.</p>

                        <p>Our goal was to provide all first responders the opportunity to fill in the missing gaps in your
                        coverage, so that you and your family will be properly protected and taken care of in case of you
                        facing an occupational hazard.</p>

                        <p>It is important to note that this plan is not intended to replace your current coverage, rather to
                        enhance it.</p>

                        <p>Every First Responder in Canada qualifies for this unique plan.</p>
